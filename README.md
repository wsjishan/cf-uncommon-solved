# Codeforces Uncommon Solved Problems

This Python program takes two Codeforces user handles as input and finds the problems that each user has solved **exclusively**â€”in other words, the problems solved by one user but not the other. The results are saved in a text file with links to the individual problems.

## Features
- Fetches solved problems for two Codeforces users.
- Lists problems that each user solved individually (not shared by both).
- Saves results in `uncommon_problems.txt` with links to Codeforces problem pages.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
